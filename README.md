# MSCS532_Assignment1
# MSCS532_Assignment1 - Insertion Sort (Monotonically Decreasing Order)


## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project implements the **Insertion Sort algorithm** in **Python**, modified to sort a list of integers in **monotonically decreasing order**.

The algorithm is derived from the pseudocode and explanation provided in:

> Cormen, T. H., Leiserson, C. E., Rivest, R. L., & Stein, C. (2022). *Introduction to Algorithms* (4th ed.). Random House Publishing Services.

This assignment also demonstrates proper usage of **Git version control**, with **three separate commits** showing development stages of the project.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Overview

**Insertion Sort** works by building the sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element and inserts it into its correct position within the already sorted part of the array.

In this project, the algorithm is customized to sort the list in **descending order**, meaning the largest numbers come first.
